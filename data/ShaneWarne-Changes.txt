I FIRST MET Simone when she was working as a promo model for Foster’s at the Vics annual golf day in 1992. We kind of caught each other’s eye – she was such a beautiful girl. I thought, ‘This is a really cool chick, sexy and funny.’ She gave me her number and I lost it. I put it in my cigarette packet and never saw it again. I tried to track her down over the next week or two but with no luck. A few months later I was at a St Kilda Football Club function and she was working there too. ‘Oh my God, I’m so sorry,’ I said to her. ‘I lost your number.’ ‘Yeah, whatever,’ she said.

‘No I’m serious. I put it in a cigarette packet and threw it out when I finished them.’

‘No way,’ she said, and wouldn’t give me her number. I gave her mine, of course, but heard nothing. Not at first.

Then, out of nowhere a couple of months later, she called to say merry Christmas. She didn’t know much about me, so I told her I was playing in the Boxing Day Test for Australia and asked her to meet me for a drink after play on the first day. 

‘I don’t know,’ she said. ‘I don’t think it’s for me.’

I said, ‘I’ll bring a mate, you bring a mate,’ and after a bit of persuasion she agreed. So, as I mentioned in an earlier chapter, myself and Damien Martyn went out to Bobby McGee’s with Simone and her friend … Simone. Yep, she was also called Simone – bizarre, but true. Even more bizarre, Simone 2 and Marto hit it off and a few months later were engaged.

Anyway, I kept in touch with Simone 1 this time and we began to hang out more and more. I talked her into coming to Perth for the Test against West Indies. That was the match in which Curtly Ambrose took 7/1 and we got hammered. She wasn’t impressed. Next thing, I was back in Melbourne having dinner with her parents, Bryan and Coral, and things just developed. She came to England in 1993 and hung out with Sue Hughes, Merv’s wife. They stayed at bed and breakfasts – nothing flash, because, back then, we weren’t allowed wives or girlfriends in the hotel at all, not even in the bar. We paid for their flights and hotels and were expected to sneak over to their joint! Simone and Sue went to Santorini in Greece for some mid-tour sunshine and loved it there, so we really didn’t see much of them. The players shared rooms in those days – in my case mainly with Merv and Mark Waugh, or sometimes with Boony. Me and Boony smoked a lot of cigarettes together, we were like Cheech and Chong. It was hardly a place for your girl.

By the way, half the side either smoked regularly or had the odd dart. We were sponsored by Benson & Hedges, remember. Boony, Geoff Marsh, Bruce Reid, Greg Matthews, AB when he was having a drink, me and the physio Errol Alcott were smokers. Mark Taylor, Mark Waugh, Dean Jones, Ian Healy, Craig McDermott and Merv all used to give us a hard time. Six smokers in the rooms. It was partly the culture at the time and partly the sponsors making the fags so available – the dressing-rooms stank of cigarettes! So much of life was so different back then. On the smoking front, everyone just lit up – in restaurants, trains, cars and planes. I used to bag a non-smoking seat on flights and then hibernate in the back corner of the plane with my fags.

I remember one funny moment. India were touring, and on a flight to Perth, Venkatapathy Raju, the left-arm spinner, snuck into the back with us, chainsmoked and got completely pissed on two cans of Swan Light. I think he was more terrified of his captain, Mohammad Azharuddin, finding out about the darts than the beers, so we gave him a bunch of mints and told him to crash out for an hour. I’m not sure it worked, to be honest. He was sheepish for days. For all the rules about wives and girlfriends at the hotel, Simone and I were seeing more of each other than most. A few days after the Gatting ball in early June, we took some time off together in the Lake District. On  the second day we hired a rowing boat but I just couldn’t get the rhythm of rowing the damn thing and we kept going round in circles. The longer it went on, the funnier it got. The truth was, though Simone didn’t know it, I was nervous. I really felt something strong with her and, right then, out on the water, after the Gatting ball, a win in the first Test on my first tour of England, the man-of-the-match award, and all the excitement and attention that was around us … I proposed. I didn’t go there to propose but, I dunno, everything was so cool in our world and I just came out with it.

‘We’re getting along really well – so what do you reckon?’

‘What do you mean, “reckon”?’

‘I mean, what do you reckon … like, how about we go for it?’

‘What do you mean, “go for it”?’ (Perhaps she was thinking, ‘Shane, you can start by rowing in a straight line.’)

I said, ‘Well, let’s get married. What do you think? Do you want to spend the rest of your life with me?’

And without missing a beat, she said, ‘Yes.’

‘Great! That’s amazing. Let’s do it then … we’ll have so much fun together. Awesome.’

Simple as that. It wasn’t the most romantic proposal ever, but, gee, it was sure a romantic place. Except for the boat still going around in circles. Our next game was in Bristol and I asked Mum and Dad down to meet some of the great people I’d played with and met during my time in club cricket there – Mike Gerrish, or ‘Biggsy’ as everyone knew him, and Merv, Maureen and Pat, who all ran the George pub. I told everyone not to say a word because I still had to call Simone’s dad. A bunch of us were in Biggsy’s car and Mum and Dad pulled up alongside us. I couldn’t help myself and just blurted out, ‘Hey, guess what, I got engaged,’ and they were like ‘Whaaat?!’ And we just kept driving to the pub.

Once there I rang her dad, Bryan, from a call box, shoving the coins in and getting a shitty line. I asked for his permission and he answered ‘Go for it!’ He never complained, and was delighted.

Mum and Dad really liked Simone but weren’t sure if I was doing the right thing at that stage of my life – just 23 and with so much suddenly going on. She was my first proper girlfriend. I had kissed at 15 and gone a step or two further over the next couple of years. But not until I was 17 did I … well, you know. Then I had the crush on Michelle Scott at school and later Pauline Vaughan – when I was touring Europe with mates straight out of school – the girls I talked about in Chapter 3. I liked Melissa Judd too but her dad didn’t approve of me! Only in England in 1989 did I start to get it together with girls. Anyway, the point is that Simone was my first full-time proper girlfriend and I loved being with her. It was a time of ‘firsts’. In February 1994 I bought my first house in Tuxen Court in East Brighton for $240,000 – I put down 50K and borrowed the rest. Simone moved in and we did it up together, put in a pool – all the gear – and then it became the regular spot for the Australian team’s Christmas Eve parties.

I started earning $3000 a year from my Cricket Board contract, which shot up to 10K after the Ashes tour in ’93. There were match payments on top of that for both Test and one-day cricket – $1500 and $500 respectively, I think. In Shield cricket, I got a couple of hundred bucks per match and an extra 50 if I wore Kookaburra protective gear. The Australian Cricket Board contract went up to 30K a year or so later, but we were hardly turning into millionaires. The gamechanger was sponsorship.

My managers Austin ‘Ocker’ Robertson and John Cornell were really big in those days. They’d both played a major part in the establishment of World Series Cricket with Kerry Packer, and John teamed up with Paul Hogan to make the Crocodile Dundee movies.

With John by his and my side, Ocker did a huge deal with Nike – $1.25 million over five years. It was unheard of at the time. Then Just Jeans came in at 250K a year for three years. Suddenly I could pay off the house.

The deals came on the back of the fact that I was getting a lot of air time. On one Valentine’s Day, a newspaper ran a poll asking parents – mums actually – who they would most like their daughter to come home with as a Valentine date. I won! I was on TV shows, doing ads for various products, and my face led the Nike campaign in Oz, which was huge. I won a couple of cars too – international player of the summer for both Test and one-day cricket against South Africa and New Zealand. I drove these two Toyotas round the Adelaide Oval. It was mad back then. Oh, and I was voted Australian sportsperson of the year in 1994. It was like someone had their finger on the fast-forward button.

Nike

As part of the arrangement with Nike, I did some TV commercials for them, and got to hang out in Portland, Oregon with Nike founder Phil Knight, the great American NFL and Major League Baseball player Bo Jackson and Michael Jordan. Nike had me designing a new range of footwear for the global cricket market and sold it as the best cricket shoe ever made. The batting one was called Air Century; then there was Air Oval, Air Flipper and the Max trainer – ‘The Nike Collection by Shane Warne’. I don’t mind admitting that this felt pretty cool!

Guys like Brian Lara were on the phone saying, ‘Send me those shoes,’ and once the best players started wearing them, they flew out of the door. Knight would stand up at events and introduce me as this amazing cricketer from ‘Orrstralia’, and everyone was gushing. In the States, in the UK and at home I was invited to everything – concerts, Grand Prix, exhibitions.

Just Jeans

I also did the catwalk with Helena Christensen and Claudia Schiffer at a Just Jeans show in Melbourne. I walked out with Helena and said, ‘How cool is this!’ and she went ‘Ssshhhh!’ Oh, okay. I kept going to the end of the catwalk, spun round with my best ‘blue steel’ look in an effort not to giggle, and headed back to where we’d come from and through to backstage.

The next thing I knew, she had all her clothes off, tits out. I thought, ‘Oh shit.’ Then she had the next outfit on before I’d barely had time to blink, never mind have a look. At which point she turned to me and said, ’Listen, you do not talk when we walk out there, you just walk, stare straight ahead at whoever or whatever you want, get to the end, turn around, walk back and do it all over again. Just concentrate on what you’re doing.’ Oh, right.

That was about it with her and I can’t say I had much of a chat with Claudia either. Helena was dating Michael Hutchence of INXS at the time. I met Michael in Perth after one of their concerts. We had a beer backstage and I told him the story. He had a laugh about it and then called Helena over. I didn’t know she was there! Anyway, she had a giggle about it too and said, ‘Sorry, but I do that stuff every day – must have got out of bed the wrong side that morning!’ I’ve got a big picture in my house of Helena and me walking down the catwalk. I was in good shape through most of the ’90s – certainly from 1992 with TJ up to 1998 when my shoulder went. After the operation – a SLAP lesion that surgeons usually perform on javelin throwers – I had it in a sling for six weeks, so I didn’t train at all and ate rubbish food. Then there was the second spinningfinger op, wire and all that, and I was down on myself for a while. I got heavy, back up to 95 kilograms, and lost motivation for training and other stuff. Operations and rehabilitation are a hidden side of sporting life. The surgery can be frightening and the trauma sucks oxygen out of you.

So, yeah, 1998 to 2001 I was overweight. Then I was fit again from 2002 till 2006/07. I think the idea that I was always a fat bastard comes from first impressions. Those first two Tests against India, before I went and hung out with TJ in Adelaide, yep, I wasn’t in very good shape. But after that, well, I wouldn’t have been in blue jeans on the catwalk with Helena if I was still a fat bastard. The funny thing is that, as I’ve mentioned, I’ve never been into food and never will be. I reckon sitting in a restaurant is a waste of time, the same as cooking. I’d rather have a pizza on the couch than, say, go out to a fancy restaurant and discuss the quality of the meat. I hate those flash restaurants with tiny portions that already tell you to head for the McDonald’s drive-through on the way home, as you’re still hungry. Food gets in the way of a good time. Eat, go, party. I’m all about atmosphere and vibe. And music. As I see it, a steak is a steak: what’s the big deal? Spaghetti bolognese is about as far as it goes with me, unless we have people round and then I’ll do a barbecue chicken, burgers or sausages. I’ll eat if I’m hungry, and I won’t if I’m not. I like hot chips, pasta, pizza, white-bread cheese sandwiches and apples – everything else I can take or leave, mainly leave. I do like ribs and roast pork too. But if there’s an opposite to a foodie, I’m it.

I’m not a heavy daily drinker either, by the way. I used to do a lot of beers but gave that up when I was getting fit with TJ. Now I like a glass of wine, red mainly – I did a wine course a few years back actually – and if I’m out at night I’ll drink vodka and Red Bull. But that’s more a binge thing. I can go weeks without a drink, I don’t even think about it, and then when I hit the clubs I might be on the vodka till four in the morning. And, by the way, I’m no slouch. I can drink most people under the table. 

I just put on weight, that’s all. Blame the diet, or lack of it. When I want tolose weight, I can do that too. I’m one thing or the other, nothing in the middle. I did like one cold beer after a bowling day.

11,660 Balls Already

We’d drawn 1–1 with South Africa over three Tests at home either side of the 1993/94 Christmas and New Year period, then headed to South Africa in late February for the second leg of three more Tests, along with eight one-dayers. I hadn’t had a proper break from the game since starting out in Test cricket and, frankly, I was a bit of a wreck by the end of the 1993/94 home season. I’d bowled 8843 balls (1473.5 overs) in first-class cricket in  32 matches in the 1993 calendar year alone – the most of any bowler in a calendar year since Bishan Bedi in 1976 and not beaten by anyone since! (The most ever was another legbreak bowler, Tich Freeman of Kent, who bowled 2378.2 overs in 1928. Bet he was tired.)

In fact, from Boxing Day 1992 to the end of the South Africa tour in April 1994, I played 40 first-class matches for Australia and Victoria – the most of any player in the world. I bowled 11,660 balls (1943.2 overs) – many more than anyone else – taking 191 wickets (the most again) at 22.21 – 4143 more balls in that period than Tim May, who was second on the list. In that period I played 22 Tests, five Sheffield Shield matches, another first-class game in New Zealand prior to the series there, 10 first-class games in England against counties and universities, and two first-class games against South African provincial sides. And I got engaged. See what I mean, exhausted! Something had to give. When we arrived in South Africa, AB gave me the first two weeks off. He said, ‘Miss the warm-up games and just come to the nets if you fancy a bowl, bat, catch, or whatever. Otherwise have daily physio, do some light training and take it easy – we want you to be right for the first Test.’

The long and short of those instructions was that I had two free weeks in Joburg. There was temptation everywhere, in its many faces. I was out every night, back just before sun up, crashing out in the change-room. Warne was on fire …

But this was extremely bad preparation for a Test series against a good side and, deep down, I knew it. I’d lost focus on the disciplines that had brought me a great couple of years. Things had spiralled, almost out of control. With the recent series in Australia, this was the return leg in what was effectively a six-match showdown. We were the first Aussie touring side since 1969/70 and thousands of people met us at the airport and interest followed us wherever we went. We even met Nelson Mandela and South African President FW de Klerk. They were hazy, crazy days and cricket was king. Part of the excitement came from South Africa’s return to the international stage after the apartheid years, and part of it the quality of the teams and players around the world at that time. Every series had real edge.

The first Test was at the Wanderers, a ground where Hansie Cronje’s guys fancied themselves and where the crowd got very aggressive, driving their boys on. The Wanderers wasn’t called the Bull Ring for nothing. The whole situation felt very hostile. During Australia’s last Test series in South Africa, under Bill Lawry’s captaincy, they’d smashed us 4–0, and it was pretty obvious the locals had missed the smell of Aussie blood.

The two first innings were almost dead even – 251 played 248 in their favour. I’d been off the pace in general, and my bowling had been ordinary, so I could see why AB didn’t bring me on immediately in the second innings. After a while, though, I was ticking because we weren’t looking like taking a pole and the crowd were getting into us. Hansie Cronje and Andrew Hudson developed a second-wicket partnership, and the longer it continued the more I was tearing at the leash to bowl.

Then, out of the blue, after 43 overs, AB said, ‘Come on, Warney, we need a wicket.’

I remember saying to myself, ‘Why didn’t you bowl me earlier then!’ In my first over I bowled Hudson round his legs, sweeping. I’ve got no idea how or why but I completely lost the plot. I look at the footage now and think, ‘That’s not me, is it? Is that me?’

I can see a kind of rage in my eyes and anger in my body language. In short, I told him to fuck off and then I chased him, still shouting, louder and louder. I had a goatee, which is kind of a mean look anyway, and I had this irrational anger pouring out of me. Looking back, it was definitely the build-up of everything over the previous 18 months, not just that moment. I snapped and I’m not proud of it.

After the day’s play, I went to Jonty Rhodes, who I knew pretty well, and asked if I could have a word with Hudson because I wanted to apologise to him. ‘Come on in, mate,’ he said, ‘we’re all having a laugh about it.’ I went into the dressing-room and they were all giggling. I said, ‘Look, it wasn’t funny, I’m sorry,’ and Andrew was like, ‘Hey, no problem.’ We shook hands and all had a beer and that was that. (Oh, for the good old days when we could have a laugh, share a beer, break down barriers and form lifelong friendships with the opposition.)

That wasn’t the end of it, though. The ICC fined me, the Australian Cricket Board fined me my match fee, there was talk of a ban – all sorts. Apparently, the radio journalist Tim Lane had walked onto the middle of the MCG back home and done a piece saying he was embarrassed to be an Australian. It was an unbelievable overreaction. Allan Border was steaming.

Merv was fined too. He’d walked up the player’s race – which has a cage around it at the Wanderers – after playing a rubbish shot and being dismissed, and some idiot shouted abuse, so Merv threatened him with his bat. To be honest, it didn’t look great and Merv later said he regretted it. I said, ‘Really? That doesn’t sound like you, mate.’ He said, ‘No, no, mate, my regret was that I should’ve smacked the prick in the head. At least the fine would have been worth it.’

I’ve never experienced a crowd like that one in 1994: everywhere we went, the streets, the hotels, the ground, the Joburg people were so hostile. By the time you walked down that race and on to the Bull Ring, you were ready to go 10 rounds with Rocky. They were throwing things at us, smashing stuff around us, grabbing our hats through the wire of the cage as we walked on and off, badmouthing us, so when it came time to bat and bowl we were raring. In a way, I love that passion and, anyway, I can hardly complain because the Aussie crowds can be OTT too.

I love South Africa. I’ve been back a million times since and have many friends there. But I never fully understood the reaction to us in 1994. Maybe we’d got too cocky and the crowds picked up on that. Or maybe, we hadn’t been back for so long that the chance to get one over us was a nationwide thing, not just a cricket thing. We were the best team in the world and what was clear was that anyone and everyone wanted to knock us off our perch. I guess it was as simple as that.

We ended up drawing the series 1–1. It was the same result as their tour to Australia and an accurate reflection of the contest between us. In general, the South Africans were a very good side – tough and smart. Kepler Wessels was a tough leader and South Africa had some good variety in their attack. The oneday series was a ripper as well: it finished 4–4 after we won the unbelievably tense final game by one run.

Incidentally, the Daryll Cullinan thing really caught on in Australia. Everyone played up to it, including the crowds. I just kept knocking him over and the harder he tried to give it back to me, the worse it got for him. The press heard that he was seeing a sports psychologist to learn how to cope with me. The next time he took guard, I asked him what colour the couch was and knocked him over again.

I always thought Daryll should have come in with a beer after a day’s play and said ‘I missed another straight one, hey, Warney’ or ‘I didn’t pick it again!’ Then we’d have laughed about it and I might not have been quite so killer in my desire to knock him over every time!

Anyway, after that crazy start of mine, it turned out a great tour. The South African players themselves and the people who looked after us were fantastic. Hotels, security, officials – everyone was great, so welcoming, and we made a lot of good friends that remain to this day. Sure, the crowds got to us and, no, I’m not on Daryll’s Christmas card list. But South Africa 1994 was fun. We’re Going to the Como, But First, We’re … Going

To Get Married

It finally happened on 1 September 1995, in a beautiful Melbourne park, the one on the left as you drive down Williams Road in South Yarra. No church or chapel, just the park and a marquee for the after party, along with the Victorian cricket chaplain for the vows, of course.

While we were waiting for Simone to rock up, AB came up to me and said, ’You okay, mate, you don’t look great. You sure you want to go through with this? You can still pull out, you know.’

I said, ‘Simone’s a wonderful girl, mate – let’s get it done.’

It felt great on the surface but deep down I’d begun to feel I shouldn’t be doing this. Or maybe I should. Or shouldn’t? Perhaps it’s the way everyone feels in the days before they get married, I thought. Who knows? It was nothing to do with Simone. She looked so beautiful on the day, and in the year and a bit since we’d got engaged she’d easily become my best friend. We were good together, she understood me and me her. But I could feel my life changing at frightening speed and I just wasn’t sure it was the right time.

Shaun Graf, my Victorian mentor and team-mate, was MC in the marquee. We had 200 people and Simone did a great job, decking it out magnificently and making sure the detail was spot on. Everyone got plastered. We stayed at the Como Hotel – a fantastic place. My brother was best man, with the groomsmen being Merv Hughes and a good mate from my Academy days, Stephen Cottrell. Simone had her sister, Lisa, and best friend, Sharon, and her cousin Tanya. A guy called Tuffy, who used to play guitar in a Hawaiian shirt at a place called City Rowers in Brisbane, did the entertainment – he was better than brilliant, playing all the great covers, many of them with Steve Waugh and Mark Taylor on stage. ‘Tugga’ loved ‘Khe Sanh’ and Tubby loved ‘Bow River’, the two Cold Chisel classics. We all had such a happy night. I remember thinking it had been the best day of my life. What was all the worry about?! On a slightly different subject, I can hear the question, ‘Steve Waugh was at your wedding?’ Well, he was. I was close with Tugga back then. We toured Zimbabwe together in 1991 and he asked me to come and play club cricket with him at Bankstown – he even spoke to the club about getting me a job behind the bar. We hung out a lot in those days and I did consider going to play in Sydney to try to get into the New South Wales team but, as I’ve mentioned, Simon O’Donnell set me straight on that one! Tugga wasn’t in the Test side when we got to know each other well; he’d been left out for a while but came back against West Indies in 1992/93, batting at number three. Then he settled into the middle order, which suited him best.

He became a completely different person when he took over as captain. All that worship of the baggy green – some of the guys went with it, like Lang, Haydos and Gilly, but it wasn’t for me. I think he turned into a more selfish player when he had his second run in the Test team, which changed him. My  philosophies on the game were more aligned with Tubby than with Steve; though, in fairness, Steve was a successful cricketer – if in a very different way to AB and Tubs, whose style and direction I much preferred. It’s no secret that Tugga and I don’t see eye to eye these days.

Simone

Simone and I have three amazing children. We spent 13 great years together, created a beautiful home in Middle Crescent, and even though we went through a few dramas, we look back now and can have a laugh.

My relationship with her is fantastic. We have brought up Brooke, Jackson and Summer together. We think differently about parenthood – I’m a lot stricter in many ways – which has been a good thing for them as they’ve seen different points of view. She understands me, I understand her and we get along fine and are friends.

There’s a perception out there that every relationship is driven by the same rules – society’s white picket fence, if you like. Mum, Dad, wife and kids, good job, solid home – and above all loyalty to your partner. But reality isn’t like that. Simone and I made our marriage work. The intimate details of how are not for the public domain. Do people really think we’d still be such good friends if it was all as bad as people make out?

As I’ve said, my life was going nuts. I think maybe we were more sister and brother – we loved going to the movies, playing pool, seeing concerts, hanging out at the pub, but perhaps we didn’t have that emotional lock-in. My respect for her remains to this day.

In the early years together we were really happy, enjoyed creating homes and sharing day-to-day life with friends and family – all the normal stuff that young couples do as they grow together. The trouble with cricket is that it invades your space, occupying everything from conversation to consistency in a relationship. Friends looking to catch up start by wanting to know the gossip about the cricket, so the blokes hang out at one end of the room and the girls the other. When that’s done and you’re back at home together the next morning, planning a movie or night out or something, more often than not you’re planning it while packing a bag or suitcase. International cricketers are always on the move. The amount of time away is ridiculous, months on end, and it’s unfair on wives and children. Then, when you come back from four months in England or 12 weeks in Pakistan, you have to get to know your partner again. Dressing-room habits die hard: in-jokes, language, untidiness and all that stuff that is natural on tour. It spills over into home life and creates an edgy environment that needs ironing out. I was lucky that Simone understood this and the sacrifices that came with it. Success at the highest level comes with a price but she always supported me, no matter what – which I’m thankful for.

Sport is, or was, a man’s world and that has the potential to overrun family life in a way that a sportsman might not realise because everything – the whole rhythm of how families live their life together – revolves around him, or me in this case. It’s a huge sacrifice your partner makes so that everything revolves around the sport. This might not always be a conscious thing, but it is a fact. We bought a house out near Portsea on the Mornington Peninsula, at Arthur’s Seat, with great views across the countryside and down to the bay. We had happy holidays there when we weren’t travelling abroad: tennis court, pool, barbecues – the kids loved it. At Christmas, our parents, Jase and his family and Simone and all her family would come and join us there for one great big family party. Most years Simone would do the whole turkey thing and, as Dad or Bryan carved, I’d be pulling my lunch out of the pizza oven I’d installed on the back deck. There was lots of laughter at our place but, of course, we were interrupted by the incidents, or ‘scandals’, that the media turned into long-running shows. That was the test – the tough times when everything was so public.

The worst of these was probably in 2000 when I was having my first stint at Hampshire and the Daily Mirror in the UK got hold of a series of drunken texts I’d sent to a girl I met at a club in Leicester, Donna Wright. I’d spoken to her for about half an hour – that’s all, half an hour – but we swapped numbers. It became a binge-drinking night – vodka/Red Bull – and I sent the texts when I got back to my room. They were pretty full-on. She sent plenty too. A million jokes have come from them but they weren’t funny, and neither was the situation I created. The whole thing was just plain dumb of me.

In England, the story soon blew over, but in Australia, oh my God, it had legs, arms, fingers and toes. It was everywhere – talkback radio, TV, newspapers and magazines. I ended up being interviewed by Mike Munro on A Current Affair, apologising for the texts. That was stupid of me too, publicly apologising for a private matter.

I said something like ‘I didn’t think it would become public. Now that it has, it’s a mistake. If it hadn’t become public, it wouldn’t be a mistake.’ That comment just made things worse and, in hindsight, I accept that I explained myself badly. I should have just admitted to a mistake and accepted it. From there it seemed like all Australia was on my case. I wanted to say, ‘What it’s got to do with anyone else except Simone and me?’, but by now, nothing I could have said would have helped.

After a few more girls had come out and exaggerated a consensual night of fun, Simone asked a clever question – are there any more that could come out? I thought about it and said, ‘I don’t think so.’ That was humiliating for Simone, for sure. I was certainly testing her loyalty, along with the things we still held valuable between us. In the years that followed, the pressure became more and more intense for both of us. We just grew apart.

The split came in early 2005. We decided to sell the house in Middle Crescent – the house I still love the most and was to buy back for a high price 10 years later – and I agreed to buy a new one for Simone just down the road. Meantime, Dad was on the lookout for me while I was playing in the Ashes series in England and found something pretty good in Park Street, less than 100 metres from Simone.

The divorce time was difficult. She was hurt and angry, and the way the press focused on it seemed to magnify every tiny detail. Why did she ever marry him? Should have left him years ago. That stuff.

She’d put up with everything previously and now still stayed by my side, because she knew we had something going together that the outside world couldn’t see. Sadly, we were on a different wavelength; I was lost in cricket and all that it brings.

At the time, as news of the split and the inevitable divorce got out, I felt deeply sorry for the children. They were too young to fully understand but I knew I’d let them down.

In private I was as upset as I ever remember being about anything. In hotel rooms on tour, I’d look at photos of them and wonder how the hell I had got it so wrong and how it would all work out. Michael Clarke spent hours with me – sometimes over a pizza in the room, other times in the corner of a bar – just keeping me going. Thanks, Pup – it meant the world to me.

I hadn’t seen it getting worse, however, but it did. Simone, Brooke, Jackson and Summer flew to London together for the start of the Ashes in July 2005, and on the day of their arrival a graphic story broke in the British tabloids about another girl. It was horrendous and there was no way back. After three days, they flew home. That was basically that. Did I feel sorry for Simone? Of course, yes, it was another humiliation for her. As I say, I was embarrassed, and also distraught to see the kids in such a mess. Look, there was anger on my side too. Certain things had broken down in the marriage that weren’t all my fault. But in the end, the blame lay at my door and I take full responsibility.

The truth is that we shouldn’t have married so young. She might well agree with that – I don’t know. I accept that I let down the people closest to me. The road back to a harmonious and meaningful relationship was all but impossible. But in the end we have three amazing children who came from our relationship. Simone soon started finding fame of her own – Dancing with the Stars, TV commercials, a slot on Channel Seven at the spring racing carnival, columns in magazines. I didn’t believe she should have used me as the weekly subject for her columns but, in general, I was happy for her that some identity of her own had won through.

As time went on, the anger subsided and we began to rebuild our friendship. Neither of us found anyone else and we started to see more of each other again through the kids. We were alternating Christmases and in 2009, I think it was, we said, ‘This is ridiculous. How about we move back in together and make all this stuff so much easier and so much better for Brooke, Jackson and Summer?’ So we had a crack, just to see how it would work out. The answer was not so well. Our reasons for getting back together were admirable, as we tried for the kids, but they could sense that their mum and dad weren’t happy. It soon became obvious enough to us all that the basics of a strong relationship had broken down.

The fact is, we’d grown too far apart. A lot has happened to us since 1992 but the bottom line, and the truth, is that we changed. The other truth is that I hurt my family and that is something I have to live with. I hold my hands up and hope Brooke, Jackson and Summer can forgive me. I know those memories still hurt my children, but the wonderful relationship we have now is enough to heal. The Ashes of 2005 was a strange time for me. On the one hand there was the divorce and all the angst that creates; on the other was the business of a good England team staring us in the face and saying, ‘What have you got?’ I’m lucky in that I’ve always been a good sleeper and the only thing that mattered, cricket wise, in this period, was to arrive at the ground fresh and relaxed. I didn’t go out much that series anyway, to be honest; the paparazzi were hunting me down. So I hung out in my room with the guys, Pup mainly, and bunkered down. I was also able to throw myself into the Test matches with complete focus. When I cross the white line, everything is left behind. I love what I do and am good  t it, so I had something important and consuming to fall back on. My attitude was, you’ve let down the people you love; you’d better not let down the game you love too. Most of the time, fame is not that much fun, anyway; it had sure contributed to the breakdown of my marriage. The fame thing came from bowling a decent leg-break but was not the reason behind it. Maybe the Ashes of 2005 underlines that better than any other cricket I played.

Birth

Until you have children, I don’t think you can understand what being in love with someone really means. When I first saw Brooke, I thought, ‘Wow, that’s it, that’s love!’ The connection was intense and now Simone and I were ‘Mum and Dad’ ourselves. I used to see people with kids and think, ‘What are they doing with their lives?’ In that moment, I got it.

On 27 June 1997 we were playing in Oxford against the Universities when Simone went into labour. The game was washed out and me and Tubs were smoking cigars over a beer in the pavilion in anticipation of the birth of my first child. Then Simone’s sister, Lisa, rang with a sense of panic in her voice. She said Simone had been rushed to hospital for an emergency C-section and then said, ‘I’ve gotta go – I’ll phone you back.’ Oh my God!

After the 14-week scan, we’d wanted to know if we were going to have a girl or boy. Simone was up for a pink room, me for blue. It was to be pink. I was disappointed as hell but now, nervously sitting in that little Oxford pavilion, I was praying for a 100 per cent healthy child – that’s all, nothing more. I guess everyone does. As far as Shane Warne, Oxford University 1997, was concerned, a healthy, happy little girl had suddenly become a damn cool idea. Then Lisa rang back. Great news, all good, Simone well, baby healthy. I said, ‘Thank God.’ Yes!

Then I said, ‘Boy or girl?’ Can you believe that? How weird. It shows the state I was in. Lisa said, ‘Are you serious? Your first child is a girl, Shane, you’ve even chosen the name for her!’ We’d decided on the name – Brooke – straight away, easy. I asked Lisa to send some pictures super quick, like right then! What a day.

At the lunch break, first day of the Old Trafford Test, there was a parcel sitting at my spot in the changing-room and I thought, ‘What’s this?’ I lit a dart, opened the parcel, and there were photographs of my first daughter. I was shocked. Oh my God, that can’t be my child, what is that?! So I didn’t show anyone – I hid them in my bag.

After play, I caught up with Mum and Dad. They said, ‘Have you got any pictures?’ I said, ‘No, haven’t got any yet.’ I was just too embarrassed to show them the photos – she looked like a smashed tomato. That can’t be my child, surely. The next day, I’d got over the shock and did show Mum and Dad. They said, ‘Jesus, what a mess.’ Normally everyone says how beautiful your baby is, but mine … mine did not look beautiful at all. (Later, Lisa explained the photographs were taken before Brooke was even bathed and cleaned. Silly me!) After the Test match I begged not to play in the two tour games against counties and to fly home instead. I just had to see my child. The management were cool, so I flew back via Hong Kong with Gilly, who was injured and heading home. He was so upset at missing out on the tour that I spent half the flight counselling him. And there was me, trying to get some sleep to be ready to see my newborn child.

I landed, jumped in a cab, sped home and Simone came to the door – glowing. She took me to the cot and there, wrapped in blankets, was our baby girl. She was so beautiful. What were those pictures about?! I was blown away by Brooke, and I couldn’t take my eyes off her. I just cuddled her, held her, and fell asleep on the couch with her on my chest. It was tough to leave two days later but I did so knowing that something unique and awesomely special had happened to my life.

Jackson was born two years later – 20 May 1999. We were playing an early World Cup game in Cardiff against New Zealand and lost. I hung a banner over the change-room balcony saying, ‘Welcome to the world, Jackson – lots of love Shane, Simone and Brooke,’ but some officials came and told me to take it down because it was hanging over a sponsor’s board. I was so angry they did that. We were all in a filthy mood. The Kiwis beat us pretty easy and a bit of siege mentality had set in early, so we got on the piss that night, like we’d lost the World Cup and the Ashes on the same day. Actually, my mood changed fast and the night out became a celebration for me – having a son was like, you little beauty! By the way, I didn’t dare have any pictures sent(!) and there was no gap in the schedule to fly home. I was fine about it. I had a great vibe about Jacko. I think it was a boy thing.

Then, on 12 October 2001, Summer was born and, finally, I was there at the birth. My respect for women went through the roof that day. Us guys think we’re tough! Geez, I saw Simone go through real pain. It was an unbelievable experience to witness that. Being a mother might be the hardest job in the world, but if it’s not, giving birth is.

I immediately had a new respect for my parents when we had Brooke. I realised that I would never, ever stop caring. My kids have been no trouble and put up with a lot of crap. I so admire them for that. We now have three wellrespected, well-rounded people as our children. Sure, social media has placed the spotlight on them. There’s no hiding place.

And yes, I’ve been embarrassed by some of the stuff they have seen and read. Often enough, they pull me in and say, ‘Dad, you can’t be serious!’ Kids can be pretty cruel at school and mine copped a lot for a while. I know they always stuck up for me, which was amazing. These days they’re the first to admit that there are upsides to the lifestyle they have known; like their friends can come  ver to hang out with Chris Martin, who is a great mate, or hang out backstage with Ed Sheeran – pretty cool.

As kids, you always see your dad as this old guy, so when they see me caught on camera kissing a younger girl, Brooke is like, ‘Oh no, Dad, what are you thinking about? She’s my age, isn’t she?’

‘No, she’s not your age, Brooke, she’s not 20.’

‘Dad, she’s 26.’

But we talk about it – that’s the good thing with us four. In fact, we’re always in communication with each other. That’s the key to any issue – communication. If they ask, ‘Dad, what the hell happened last night?’, I’ll tell them.

‘I met this girl, we got along great, we went out for dinner, had a few drinks or whatever.’

‘Yeah, we don’t need to know the rest!’

Their message is: you’re a single guy, go for it, but pleeese, hang out with someone your own age. Good advice.

I call them most days and text every morning and night without fail, no matter where I am in the world. If they want to call me, they will; if they don’t, fine, but we’re still in touch at least twice daily. In fact, we’re all on a group text message and, as time has gone on, we’ve become mates every bit as much as family. Mind you, they still grumble, as they always have, that I’m stricter than necessary.

To sum up, I think I’d say my actions have affected them in different ways. At times, I’ve disappointed them, which has led to anger and confusion. At other times, I’ve made them proud. They understand me, as their comments at the end of the book illustrate very well. They know I’m there for them and these days I know they’re there for me too. Brooke, Jackson and Summer are my life and my number-one priority. It’s as simple as that. I love them up to the sky and back. 

Postscript

There is hardly any point in me denying that I love sex, but I also love working out a woman – finding out what makes her tick and then what makes her happy. I can think of nothing better than being in a strong relationship and caring for each other.

I love crashing out on the couch and watching a movie together way more than hitting the town. Being single, I miss that almost more than anything else right now. Like I miss the days when the kids were growing up and we did the family things – Marco Polo in the pool, walking down the beach collecting shells, throwing a tennis ball around, movies, even Monopoly. Gee, I love Monopoly.

They sure were better days than the week-on, week-off arrangements that had to be made after the marriage break-up. The kids hated that – it made them grumpy and insecure – so we changed first to a couple of weeks at each place and ended up with a month at Simone’s and two weeks at mine. Over time, it worked itself out. These days things are more relaxed about who goes where, but the principle is now that the kids spend equal time with both of us – at least until they too have kids and, hopefully, begin to feel the respect for Simone and me that we felt for our parents.

I admit I love a lot of what being single brings: the freedom to do what you want, with who you want, when you want. But for me, it’s a no-brainer – the first preference is to have a great relationship. Second option, single. Bad relationship, no thanks.

I see mates who are in bad relationships, always on the phone fighting battles, justifying where and why, with no trust with each other about anything. I couldn’t live like that. Believe me, I’ve tried. The other thing I know is that you have to accept people for the way they are. If you don’t and you can’t tolerate something, however small, it will become a slow torture until something gives. The key to any relationship is what works for the both of you. Not what society dictates. Set the rules out and don’t break them. Respect and honesty are the key, along with expressing yourself to each other.

I think I got it pretty right with Elizabeth and I think she would say the same. But that story comes later and, for a few happy years, it really did feel like a bit of magic.
