leave Indian cricket in safe hands. I have played with the current generation of cricketers who now constitute the core of the Indian team. Batting, I feel, will continue to be our strength and the current crop, which is a good mix of experience and youth, will surely play together for many years and serve the country with distinction. On the bowling side, while some of our bowlers are doing well, we need to find a few more talented fast bowlers. In the past we have had some really good bowling pairs, but what we need now is a bowling unit that will play for the team at the same time. This is a tough challenge, but with the depth of talent available in the country, I am sure we are up to it.

Finally, the game of cricket itself is extremely vibrant. Cricket is the only sport that has three distinctive formats and each format has a constituency of its own. While Test cricket will always remain the pinnacle, one-day international cricket too is in good shape, with the Champions Trophy and the fifty-over World Cup seeing tremendous support the world over. Also, Twenty20 continues to attract the youth, as shown by the popularity of the IPL.

A lot of people have asked me what I will be doing in the future. Frankly, I don’t know. When I started out playing cricket at eleven years of age I had no idea I would go on to play for India or would play 200 Test matches. All I knew was that I wanted to play the game well and enjoy every moment. I stayed in the moment and lived each situation as they came to me.

I had never thought there would come a time when I would not be able to go out for walks with my children, or take them shopping, that going out to watch a film or taking my family out for dinner would require meticulous planning. However, I don’t regret any of it, for all of that is a small price to pay for the affection and warmth the people of my country have showered on me all the way through my career.

I am in a very similar state at the start of my second innings. All I am doing now is trying to spend a lot of time with my family and sometimes not doing anything at all! This was impossible when I was an active cricketer but now I am learning to take time off, and I must say I am enjoying myself at home. Cricket allowed us to have a place of our own, our current bungalow in Bandra West, and Anjali and I have taken care to ensure every little thing has been handpicked by us. From growing up as a child in a one-room place next to Shivaji Park, to sleeping in our living room with Ajit till 1994, to finally owning a bungalow in Bandra – by being true to cricket I have been able to fulfil a lifelong dream of owning my own house.

Something else I always wanted was to have my parents stay with me, and while my dream of having my father to stay at my own place was not fulfilled – he passed away in 1999, and we moved into our apartment in La Mer in 2000 – my mother now stays with me, giving me immense fulfilment and pride. In fact, on 28 September 2011, the day we moved into our bungalow in Bandra West, I took my mother to the bungalow at six in the morning and showed her around the whole house in her wheelchair. I had driven her in a small car to avoid attention and wheeled her in her chair myself for the entire time. She was actually the first person to enter the house, which made the occasion all the more joyous.

As I start my second innings, I will do exactly what I did when I was eleven, live and enjoy each moment. I don’t know where my life is heading, nor do I want to predict anything. I will just take things as they come, as I did when I played my first innings. There is one difference, however. As I move on in life I will always live with the satisfaction that I managed to play the first innings my way, and have been able to leave behind a legacy I can now look back on with pride.
